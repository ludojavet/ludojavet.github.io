Having recently obtained a PhD in Computer Science, I'm now working as a Research Engineer in the [Petrus team](https://team.inria.fr/petrus/) at Inria.

In partnership with the [Hippocad company](https://www.hippocad.com/), we are working on the deployment of a decentralized and privacy-preserving data management solution for dependent people receiving home assistance.
