I completed my PhD at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), where I focused on privacy-preserving distributed queries in opportunistic networks. My work lies at the intersection of distributed systems, data management, and privacy.

Afterwards, I spent two and a half years as a Research Engineer in the [Petrus team](https://team.inria.fr/petrus/) at [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre), working on [PlugDB](https://project.inria.fr/plugdb/en/), a decentralized and privacy-preserving personal data management system. In partnership with [Domiserve](https://www.domiserve.com/), I contributed to the industrialization and deployment of this solution for dependent people receiving home assistance.

I am now building my own projects and working on launching a company. Stay tuned.
